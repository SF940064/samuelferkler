    <h1> Samuel Ferkler </h1>
    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p> 
        Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Samuel Ferkler, a 24-year-old recent graduate from West Chester University. 
        I earned a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science with a minor in Statistics. 
    </p>

    <p>
        During my time at West Chester University, I fell in love with the elegance of writing software and coding projects. 
        I'm always thankful for my professors, my peers, and the memories made in the classroom. 
    </p>  

    <p>
        After graduating in May 2023, I've been working on solo projects, including game and web design (like this portfolio!), 
        to keep my coding skills sharp and challenge myself in unfamiliar territories to become a better programmer. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        My career goal is to find ways to help people through programming, whether that's designing a new website to aid people 
        in navigating the internet more easily or working on life-changing software. The opportunities to help are endless 
        in this line of work, and helping others has always been my lifelong aspiration.

        I grew up in Ridley Park, Pennsylvania, raised by the best parents anyone could ask for. 
        During my childhood, I loved playing sports at the park with my friends and riding our bicycles all over town. 
        This love for being outdoors and playing sports stayed with me throughout my upbringing and even into becoming a varsity high school athlete, 
        specializing in Lacrosse and Football. These sports were something I held onto even at the next level, college. 
        I was recruited to play Division 3 College Football at King's College in Wilkes-Barre, PA. 
        My time on the team was short-lived, however, as I struggled to find a balance between football and schoolwork. 
        Sometimes I regret walking away, but I'll cherish the memories that football gave me forever.

        Once I settled into college academics and found a groove, I discovered my new passion: coding. 
        During the spring semester of my freshman year at King's College, 
        I couldn't stop working on my coding projects. 
        I quickly realized that there is no better feeling in the world than writing code that does exactly what you wanted it to do. 
        To this day, I still feel the same. I spent hours daily in my professor, Chad Hogg's, office. 
        I couldn't put my computer down and was always ready to learn more. 
        With Professor Hogg's guidance, I became a very passionate, idealistic coder.

        After my freshman year at King's, I decided to transfer to West Chester University as I didn't have many friends 
        at King's and wanted to be closer to home. I settled into West Chester very easily. 
        I had plenty of people that I knew from towns over that I started hanging out with daily and are now some of my closest friends. 
        During my 3rd year at West Chester, I was eager to find a bartending job in town. 
        Never having bartended before, this was very challenging, as I didn't realize that you should have bartending experience to become a bartender. 
        I eventually got a job barbacking at Ram's Head Bar & Grille (Best bar ever, if you know, you know). 
        Two months at Ram's Head got me enough experience in the industry to become a bartender next door at Mas Mexicali. 
        During my time at Mas, I unlocked another passion of mine: bartending. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        What I love most about bartending is the conversations that you have. I'll always hang onto certain conversations I have with some guests. 
        Conversations that may have helped them, may have helped me, or were just friendly conversations to make their stay at my bar more enjoyable. 
        I recently left Mas Mexicali, but I'll always be thankful for the memories I made and becoming the best bartender I can be there.

        I am currently behind the bar at Flanigan's Boathouse in Conshohocken, which, in my opinion, has the best bar food I have ever experienced. 
        Come check me out behind the bar at Flanigan's on the weekends and enjoy some great beer and great food!
